                  I am Evangelia but you can call me Vanessa (it is sort of a nickname or a roepnaam as the Dutch  people say). I am 34 years old, I come from Greece and I moved in the Netherlands 3 years ago. I live in the city of Utrecht with my husband and our dog, Lisa.

                    I studied Music Science and History, but my working background is in Retail Management. I decided to change career and become a software developer not only because of the great job opportunities out there, but also because of the huge rewards in terms of self development and creative expression. Last but not least I love the fact that as a software developer -every day- one is presented with new challenges, working on potentially very complex problems. Love it!

                    Even though I miss my country and its beauties, moving to the Netherlands was one of the best choices I've ever made. Good organization and infrastructure, diversity, safety is amongst the things I like the most. Plus one gotta love the completely unpredictable weather. HA! (I am only joking. I lived on an island where the weather was similar to the weather here. I had prior experience in "all four season" days.)

                      Music has always been a part of my life; it is the center of my world. If you knew me on a personal level, you'd know that I always have a song playing in my head. I wake up listening to music and I go to sleep listening to music. I like to explore different artists and music genres and I do miss a lot going to music concerts and festivals."></div>

                      Aren't they all precious regardless of their species! In a parallel universe, I believe I would be somewhere in Africa, owning my own rescue park. In the current universe, I do my best to help animal shelters in Greece and in Africa through donations."></div>

                      What I really really miss from my country is its nature. The view of the mountains or the endless blue of the sea, is priceless for me. Whenever I get the opportunity to travel, I enjoy taking a hike on mountains, or explore new places to dive. If neither is possible, then I will sure take a long walk into the nature in order to unwind and get inspired."></div>

                      I love exploring different kinds of cousins and experiment with my cooking. I miss the Greek original taste and flavour in foods, so there is always delicious Greek food in our home, or a delicious braai (traditional African barbeque) that my husband makes."></div>

                      Science was something I never loved initially, but was rather something I felt I had the responsibility TO love. I appreciate the many ways, big and small, that it makes our lives richer and better, it combats disease and death as well as it allows us to grasp a vast universe and tiny organisms. It is mind-blowing to me, what is yet to be discovered."></div>

                      Haven't I spend hours and hours browsing and sharing memes? I often come across a picture or a meme which i find 'relatable' and I like memes of every range. From politics to anime to real life situations to a statement of a general person. I simply cannot stop browsing memes!"></div>
